# How Fakeout Works

Fakeout is designed to test and improve your ability to distinguish between real photography and AI-generated imagery. In an era where synthetic media is becoming increasingly realistic, developing a keen eye for detail is more important than ever.

## The Mechanics

In each round, you are presented with two images side-by-side.
- **One is a real photograph**, sourced from high-quality stock photography libraries.
- **The other is AI-generated**, created using state-of-the-art generative models.

Your task is simple: **Identify the AI-generated image.**

## Behind the Scenes

We use a variety of generative models to create our AI images, ensuring a diverse range of styles and "tells". Some models might struggle with hands, while others might create unnatural lighting or textures.

The real images are carefully selected to match the theme or subject matter of the AI generation, making the comparison fair but challenging.

## Why Play?

Playing Fakeout helps you:
1.  **Sharpen your critical thinking** when consuming visual media.
2.  **Learn the common artifacts** of current AI technology.
3.  **Track your progress** over time as you get better at spotting fakes.
